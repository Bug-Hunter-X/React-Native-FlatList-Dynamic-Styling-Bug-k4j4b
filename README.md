# React Native FlatList Dynamic Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component when using dynamic styles. The bug causes inconsistencies in styling, leading to flickering or incorrect rendering of list items.

## Bug Description

The problem arises when styles are calculated within the `renderItem` function and depend on the data of each item.  The style updates are not always correctly applied, resulting in visual glitches.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `useMemo` hook or `React.memo` to optimize the rendering process. By memoizing the style calculations, we ensure that styles are only recalculated when necessary, fixing the rendering inconsistencies.  See `bugSolution.js` for a corrected implementation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the inconsistent styling in the FlatList.
